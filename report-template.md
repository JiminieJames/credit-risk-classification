## Overview of the Analysis

This is an example of using Machine Learning to determine who would be a "Good Borrower" and repay their loans. This data used a variety of historial lending practices to place borrowers into low or high- risk factors. 
These factors were: 
    Debt, Income, Number of accounts etc. 

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Accuracy = 99% 
    * Precision = 92%
    * Recall = 95%

## Summary

In summary the Logical Regression model is a good method to determine a healthy borrower, not without some issues, but based on the accuracy and precision we should be able to predict with enough success to maintain profitability.
